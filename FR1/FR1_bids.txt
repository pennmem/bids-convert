FR1 BIDS conversion

Items worked on:
- Determine missing system_version information.
- Practice list serial positions 0-11, instead of 1-12.
- Serial position does not encode prior list intrusion information.
- Loading all sessions.  Check for events, contacts, pairs, monopolar, bipolar eeg.
- Depth, grid, strip, micro electrodes.
- Replace NaN or empty cells with 'n/a'.
- Mapping each subject-session to mni, tal, monopolar, bipolar.
- Determine different wordpools.
- Change negative durations to 0 so mne doesn't get mad.
- Electrode hemispheres, based off of x coordinate.
- Find all unique event types and make descriptors.
- Participants.tsv with age, sex, handedness information from REDCAP.


Quality Checks:
- No linear transformation of voltage traces (write mne objects in V).
- Signal to noise ratio = 
- Serial position 1-12.
- Monopolar and bipolar channels group labels all letters.
- Electrode hemispheres all 'L' or 'R' and group labels all letters.

Items still to work on:
- Incorporating electrode surface area information (area.txt).
- Parallelization overwriting (jobs restarting).
- Pair labels too long (mne angry if over 16 characters).
